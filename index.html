                        My name is Brandon Huddleston and I am a aspiring developer from Fort Mill, South Carolina. I decided to take this course to further my career after picking up an interest in coding in my past career at Bank of America.  In the past 3 years I have grown a fairly large set of skills that I never though I would have, and I don't plan on stopping here.  I want to push myself as far as I can so I can be "The Guy" for every job.
                        <br><br>
                        I enjoy playing video games, watching anime, and playing with my dog in my free time the most, coding may be a new hobby once I get to a level where I can make everything look and function nicely.  Other things I'm interest in are sitting outside in the fall, since Im a warm bodied person, Im not a fan of summer.  I now live in Fort Mill, where everything is busy for the most part compared to McConnells, where Im from, where there were only about 1,500 people in the entire town.
